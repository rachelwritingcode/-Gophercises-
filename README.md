## What is Gophercises?

Gophercises is a FREE course that will help you become more familiar with Go while developing your skills as a programmer. In the course we will build roughly 20 different mini-applications, packages, and tools that are each designed to teach you something different.

In the course we learn about and practice using:
```
    Channels
    Mutexes
    Goroutines
    Functional Options
    Chaining Interfaces
    Various parts of the standard library (io, time, and many other packages)
    Reading input from the command line
    And much much more!
```
